# **Django RESTful API**

Welcome to my Django RESTful API project. This project is built using the Django Rest Framework and allows for easy communication between different services.

The API is designed to handle HTTP requests and return JSON data. It provides a simple way for different services to access and manipulate data, without having to handle the intricacies of the underlying database.
